React + Next.js + Tailwind Assignment
	•	Build a responsive 3-column layout (Left Nav - 15%, Main Content - 70%, Right Info - 15%).
	•	On desktop, Left Nav and Main Content are visible, but Right Info stays hidden until the button is clicked.
	•	On mobile:
	•	Left Nav is hidden under a hamburger menu.
	•	Right Info should expand dynamically when toggled to accommodate content.
	•	Main Content: Add a title, description, and a “View Info” button to toggle the Right Info panel.
	•	Use React state (useState) for menu toggling.
	•	Implement Tailwind CSS classes carefully for smooth responsiveness and transitions.
